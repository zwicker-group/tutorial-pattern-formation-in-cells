    "From comparing the units, we know that the characteristic length scales as a square root function with the diffusion constant. Indeed, we can fit such a function to the data sweep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sweep has two obvious limitations: for too small diffusion constants (i.e., too small length scales), the spatial resolution of the numeric analysis is too low to properly identify the centers of spots, and thus no length scale can be extracted in these cases. On the other hand, once the characteristic length scale exceeds the system length, there will be only one spot in the system, so that again no characteristic length scale can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in the limit $D_i \\to 0$, the fit function fails, since no patterns can arise without diffusion. Extrapolation is therefore only meaningful in a limited parameter regime."

If the fixed point is stable, then the system converges to the fixed point, and if it is unstable, then the system diverges to $\\pm \\infty$, so no (stable) pattern is observed. For even orders, the system is not symmetric with respect to sign flips $u \\to -u$, so that the system will diverge again. Only for odd orders larger than $1$, there are sufficiently many fixed points to prevent divergence while at the same time allowing for an unstable fixed point, so that in this case patterns are possible."

    "The pattern you analysed above is a stationary pattern, i.e. it will remain the same if you continue simulating for much longer times. For a different parameter regime, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model shows dynamic patterns that reflect the 'neuron spiking' idea of the model. While these dynamic patterns are particularly difficult to analyse, they are at the same time very nice to look at. The code below simulates such a dynamic pattern. Run and enjoy!"
