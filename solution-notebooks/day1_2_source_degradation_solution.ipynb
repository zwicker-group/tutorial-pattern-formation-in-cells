    "Consider the following situation: a cell's membrane, constantly produces some chemical $c$ at a rate $k_{prod}$. This could be a protein complex that is created on the membrane, or an external chemical that is constantly uptaken by the membrane. This chemical -- whose concentration is denoted by $c_m(x,t)$ -- can move on the membrane diffusively (diffusion constant $D_m$). At a rate $k$, these chemicals detach from the membrane into the cell's volume (cytosol). In the cytosol, this chemical $c_b(x,y,t)$ diffuses as well ($D_c$), and it is degraded at a rate $k_{degr}$, for example due to (de-)phosphorylation. We look at a small (flat) region of the cell's membrane and cytosol in 2D. Here, the cytosol is a 2D plane (parameterized by the coordinates $x$ and $y$), and the membrane is a 1D line located at the boundary of the cytosol, parameterized by the coordinate $x$. More precisely, the membrane is located at height $y=0$. The differential equations corresponding to this situation are\n",

    "Since the geometry is finite, there are boundary effects once the $\\ell$ gets close enough to the system size. This problem could be solved easily by increasing the system size. In general, this means that boundary effects as well as other numerical artifacts (such as aliasing, mesh defects etc) need to be taken into account. Also, one should always make sure that the obtained results are not due to one of these numerical effects."
