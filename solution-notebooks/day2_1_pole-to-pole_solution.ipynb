    "# Pole-to-pole oscillations\n",
    "In the previous two notebooks, you learnt about the relevance of membrane interactions and how this can lead to gradients in the bulk (volume, cytosol) of a cell, and about the importance of nonlinearities in the interaction terms. Now, we will combine these two effects to reproduce a prominent example of dynamic protein pattern in living cells: the pole-to-pole oscillations of the MinCDE system in _E. coli_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MinCDE system regulates the placement of the division site in _E. coli_ bacteria. More precisely, the MinC protein inhibits the formation of the Z-ring. By oscillating between the poles, the MinC proteins is mainly located at the cell poles, and rarely at the cell center. Thus, the inhibitory effect is weakest at the cell center, such that the Z-ring forms just there, resulting in symmetric cell division.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with the system, have a look at https://static-movie-usa.glencoesoftware.com/mp4/10.7554/384/2cd69eb620315bb0a04c26d92e1300548d3bca6d/elife-03949-media1.mp4 (from Zieske and Schwille, eLife, 2014, elifesciences.org/articles/03949). The video shows protein concentrations in _E. coli_ cells of varying aspect ratio. In nature, _E. coli_ have an aspect ratio of about $5$ just before cell division, for which the proteins oscillate between the two cell poles (e.g., column 1, row 4 in the linked movie). In the following, we will aim to reproduce these oscillations in simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Min protein oscillations require only the MinD and MinE proteins; the MinC protein is needed for downstream regulation of the Z-ring, but not to maintain the patterning process. Thus, we will only use the former two proteins in the following."

    "The Min system is extremely sensitive to variations in average protein concentrations. This means that pole-to-pole oscillations can be observed, for example, at a specific protein concentration $c_E^*$, but for slightly varied concentrations ($\\pm 10 \\%$) the oscillations break down. This poses a major problem for numerical implementation: since the grid is discrete and not continuous, it is not straightforward to define a concentration that respects the conservation of mass and at the same time does not alter the PDEs. In general, this issue can be resolved by carefully rescaling all parameters and quantities based on the mesh resolution. For simplicity, however, we cheat here and use a geometry that happens to have the correct scaling (i.e., one where the grid cells have resolution 1).\n",

    "In nature, _E. coli_ cells are $5 \\mu m$ long and $1 \\mu m$ wide. To observe a pattern, we need about five grid cells (preferably much more) in each direction.
