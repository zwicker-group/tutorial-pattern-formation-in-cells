    "The pattern you analysed above is a stationary pattern, i.e. it will remain the same if you continue simulating for much longer times. For a different parameter regime, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model shows dynamic patterns that reflect the 'neuron spiking' idea of the model. While these dynamic patterns are particularly difficult to analyse, they are at the same time very nice to look at. The code below simulates such a dynamic pattern. Run and enjoy!"
